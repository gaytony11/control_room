How to install better Plane Icons on the Map for Vatsim (xPilot).

1. Open X-Plane main Folder

2. go to X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins

3. Open your xPilot Folder (X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\xPilot)

4. Go in Resources

5. You will see an Picture called "MapIcons"

6. Just drag the New "MapIcons" from my fodler into the (X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\xPilot\Resources) folder and replace it. I would recommend to save the original "MapIcons".

Have fun and if you like my mini addon please give it a rating.
